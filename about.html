                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>I'm Delfina Miguez, a designer and creative technologist based in Barcelona, working at the intersection of brand design, photography, and interactive experiences.</p>
                    <p>As founder of Delphi Design, I help organizations build visual systems that scale—from early-stage startups establishing their identity to established brands evolving their presence. My approach combines strategic thinking with hands-on craft, ensuring that design solutions are both conceptually sound and beautifully executed.</p>
                    <p>My practice spans three disciplines: graphic design focused on brand systems and campaign work, photography ranging from commercial to fine art, and creative coding exploring how interactivity can enhance storytelling. This multidisciplinary background allows me to approach projects holistically, considering how visual identity, imagery, and digital experiences work together.</p>

                    <h2>What I Enjoy Building</h2>
                    <p>Visual identities that feel alive, not static. Design systems that empower teams rather than constrain them. Campaigns that balance emotional resonance with analytical rigor. Interactive experiences that surprise without sacrificing usability. Photography that reveals something beyond the obvious.</p>
                    <p>I'm drawn to projects where strategic complexity meets creative opportunity—where the constraints are interesting and the potential for systematic thinking is high. I believe the best design work operates at multiple levels: it solves immediate problems while establishing principles that guide future decisions.</p>

                <!-- Approach -->
                <section class="content-section" id="approach">
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>I work collaboratively, valuing open dialogue and iteration. My process emphasizes understanding context deeply before proposing solutions. I ask questions that might feel uncomfortable because they're often the ones that lead to stronger work. I believe in showing work early and often, treating feedback as a tool for refinement rather than a judgment.</p>
                    <p>For brand and identity work, I focus on building flexible systems rather than rigid templates. For photography, I prioritize authentic moments over forced aesthetics. For interactive work, I emphasize clarity and intention over gratuitous complexity.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Background -->
                <section class="content-section" id="background">
                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>My journey into design was less linear than most. I studied visual communication but spent years exploring adjacent fields—photography, editorial design, front-end development—before finding my way to the intersection where I work now. This meandering path gave me perspective on how different creative disciplines inform each other.</p>
                    <p>Living and working in Barcelona shapes my practice. The city's design legacy, from Gaudí's organic modernism to the rigorous typography of the 1992 Olympics, creates a context where experimentation and craft coexist naturally.</p>
                    <p>Outside of client work, I maintain an active creative coding practice, build personal photography projects, and contribute to design communities through workshops and mentorship.</p>
