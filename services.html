    <!-- Services Content -->
    <div class="content-page">
        <h1>Services</h1>
        
        <p>I work with organizations and individuals across three core disciplines, offering both standalone services and integrated approaches that leverage multiple skills. Projects can range from focused sprint work to ongoing partnerships.</p>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>Branding & Visual Identity</h3>
            <p>Strategic brand development and visual identity systems that establish clear presence and scale with your organization. From naming and positioning to complete visual language, I build frameworks that guide consistent expression across touchpoints.</p>
            <p class="service-deliverables"><strong>Typical deliverables:</strong> Logo systems, typography and color palettes, brand guidelines, design system documentation, application templates, brand toolkits</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>Campaign & Graphic Design</h3>
            <p>Marketing campaigns, publication design, packaging, environmental graphics, and event materials. Work that translates strategic objectives into compelling visual narratives, whether for digital channels, print media, or physical spaces.</p>
            <p class="service-deliverables"><strong>Typical deliverables:</strong> Campaign concepts and art direction, social media assets, presentation design, editorial layouts, packaging design, signage and wayfinding, conference materials</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Commercial and editorial photography across brand campaigns, product, architectural interiors, portraiture, and event documentation. I work both as solo photographer and collaboratively with creative teams, adapting approach to project needs.</p>
            <p class="service-deliverables"><strong>Typical deliverables:</strong> Brand lifestyle photography, product photography, architectural and interior documentation, professional portraits, event coverage, editorial series, image retouching and editing</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-item">
            <h3>Interactive Experiences & Creative Coding</h3>
            <p>Custom digital experiences that go beyond standard web templates. From data visualizations and generative systems to brand tools and interactive installations. Work that combines design sensibility with technical implementation.</p>
            <p class="service-deliverables"><strong>Typical deliverables:</strong> Interactive brand experiences, custom portfolio sites, data visualization projects, generative design tools, brand asset generators, exhibition and installation interfaces</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>Projects typically begin with a discovery phase to establish shared understanding of objectives, audience, constraints, and success criteria. From there, I develop strategic direction and initial concepts, iterate based on feedback, and move into execution and delivery. I maintain transparent communication throughout, sharing work in progress and addressing questions as they arise.</p>

        <p>For ongoing relationships, I offer retainer arrangements providing consistent support for evolving design needs — whether that's monthly brand asset creation, regular photography shoots, or iterative development of digital products.</p>

        <h2>Let's Talk</h2>
        <p>Every project is different, so rather than fixed packages, I prefer conversations about your specific needs and goals. Reach out via <a href="mailto:delfimiguez@gmail.com">email</a> to discuss your project, and I'll respond within one business day with thoughts on approach, timeline, and investment.</p>

        <p>I'm selective about projects, prioritizing work where there's strong creative alignment and opportunity for meaningful collaboration. I work best with clients who value process, welcome dialogue, and are committed to doing things well.</p>
